# ACGenV: Automated Conversation Generation & Evaluation

This repository stores all code used for our project in CS544 Fall 2022. 

There are two main elements: 
 - conversation-generator*
 - conversation-analyzer 

*the model(s) used in the conversation-generator were not able to be uploaded entirely to GitHub due to their large size and can be made available through a Google Drive link upon request.
